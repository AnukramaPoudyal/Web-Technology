          <h3>Answer</h3>

          <p>Answer, Answer, Question
            For someone like you
            And it would be like a shooting star
            I would be a reckless gambler
            But you know you're not what they think
            And I'm willing to bet
            There'd be an earthquake if I bet against you
            I'll bet all I have on you
            But it comes down to the final shot
            I'd do anything and everything to have got that dream come true
            All I tried to do to try not to let it get away
            To find out what I was thinking and what I was doing
            Who you are to be, who you are to be
            That's another question, another answer
            Answer, answer, question.
            You are to be, you are to be</p>

          <p>Now I've Dropped Everything


            I've fallen in love with you so easily
            You don't have to be scared of me
            Now I've dropped everything
            I've found a girl
            For this chance that we share
            You don't have to be scared of me
            I could see it in the way her eyes shone
            Let's have a past, let's kiss goodbye
            And as we smoke in the ashtrays
            I wonder if we'll ever run on this memory, oh
            Oh no, no, no
            Let's stop all this screaming
            And never ever leave on the past, oh
            I don't want to see
            The tears that nobody cries
            I don't want to feel the joy of love again
            Never get to feel my loneliness
            I just can't seem to get much closer
            Then I had hoped</p>

          <h3>Last Journey</h3>

          <p>
            In the shoes of my grandfather, I stand,
            Seeking solace in words, guided by his hand.
            Through these verses, I strive to comprehend,
            The journey he undertook, until his life's end.
            
            A grand symphony of life once did he weave,
            Full of vigor, strength, and passions to believe.
            Yet fate's cruel hand struck him with despair,
            An accident, a battle he fought, unfair.
            
            In these walls, his spirit did reside,
            Beneath pale lights, where hope and pain collide.
            But through it all, a resilience unfurled,
            His spirit, unyielding, in an uncertain world.
            
            Each day a struggle, a test of his might,
            Challenged by shadows that loomed in the night.
            Yet his spirit remained unbroken and strong,
            For love and family, he carried along.
            
            With every breath, he cherished life's embrace,
            Embracing memories, with a gentle grace.
            In his eyes, I saw the wisdom of years,
            The tales untold, hidden within his tears.
            
            A lifetime of stories whispered in his gaze,
            Of love, laughter, and wistful yesterdays.
            He taught me lessons, unspoken and wise,
            To live each moment, to see through love's eyes.
            
            And as the seasons danced, their colors unfurled,
            His soul yearned for freedom from this earthly world.
            A hush fell over his fragile silhouette,
            As he embarked on a journey he couldn't forget.
            
            With grace, he surrendered to the unknown,
            Embracing peace, his spirit softly flown.
            His essence remains, a guiding light, sublime,
            Forever etched in my heart, throughout time.
            
            So now, in these verses, I honor his name,
            His spirit enduring, his legacy aflame.
            Though his earthly journey has come to an end,
            His love and wisdom forever transcend.
            
            Through the words I pen, his story shall live,
            A testament of strength and the love he'd give.
            For in the shoes of my grandfather, I stand,
            Forever grateful, held by his guiding hand.</p>

          <h3>Nothing New</h3>

          <p>New year, same old lads

            Let's discuss our leaders, oh so great
            Who sit atop our nation, but we can't relate
            Why they can't keep their reputation clean and fair
            Instead they indulge in corruption, without a single care
            
            They make promises they can't fulfill, with a grin so wide
            But when it's time to deliver, they run and hide
            They deceive and manipulate, with no sense of remorse
            And we are the ones who have to bear the course
            
            Their words are so false, their deeds even more
            They don't care about us, only about their score
            They take and take, without giving back
            And yet they blame us for their own lack
            
            They say they'll fight corruption, but what do they do?
            They themselves engage in it, and make us feel blue
            They hold our future in their dirty hands
            And they manipulate it, like a game of sands
            
            But we won't fall for their lies, we'll rise above
            And we'll make sure they know, we deserve better love
            We'll stand up for our rights, and demand what's fair
            And we'll show them that their corruption, we won't bear
            
            So let's speak up, and make our voices heard
            Let's fight for what's right, with every single word
            And we'll ensure that our nation will see
            A brighter future, where corruption will cease to be
            
            So our beloved leaders, listen to us loud and clear
            We won't let you rob our future, year after year
            We'll work towards a better tomorrow, and we'll win
            And we'll show you that honesty and integrity will always win
            
            So as our New Year 2080 resolution, let's pledge to eradicate
            Corruption from our land, and make it a better state
            We'll work hard towards our goal, with every step we take
            And we'll make sure that our nation's future is at stake.</p>

          <h3>Procrastination Blues: A Student's Lament</h3>
          <p>

            Exams are coming near, but here I am
            Scrolling TikTok and Instagram, oh damn
            No energy to study or take notes
            Just endless scrolling, what a joke
            
            I say "I'll study," but that's cap
            End up watching reels, and feel like a sap
            I tell myself "just one more vid,"
            But an hour goes by, and I feel like a kid
            
            The clock is ticking, the deadline draws near
            But I'm still here, scrolling without any fear
            Thinking I have time, that I can catch up
            But the reality is, I'm really screwed up
            
            I watch videos of cats and dogs
            Dance challenges, and silly pranks of all sorts
            Thinking it's just for a minute or two
            But hours fly by, what can I do?
            
            I know I should be studying, it's true
            But TikTok's algorithm's got me in its queue
            The reels keep coming, one after the other
            And before I know it, the exam's here, oh brother
            
            I try to cram, but my mind's all over the place
            Thinking of the videos, I've watched and their pace
            I get stressed, anxiety creeps in
            Wondering how I'm going to ace this thing
            
            And when the exam day finally arrives,
            I feel like a fool with hollow eyes,
            All night I cram and try to recall,
            The things I should have learned in fall.
            
            The morning comes with a dreadful sound,
            Of my alarm clock that I want to drown,
            I get dressed and head to school,
            Feeling like a clueless fool.
            
            And then the exam is over, and I feel so dumb
            Realizing that social media's not worth the fun
            I promise to myself, to study next time
            But I know I'll end up doing the same old crime
            
            So if you're like me, addicted to TikTok and Instagram
            Remember to put the phone down and stick to the plan
            Study hard, and don't let social media distract
            Or else you'll end up like me, feeling the exam regret.

          <h3>Teen World</h3>
          <p>In the realm where wisdom seeks its home,
            Amidst the halls of knowledge, we roam.
            A tapestry of youthful dreams unfurled,
            The vibrant canvas of the student world.
            
            We gather at the threshold of our prime,
            Eager hearts beating in rhythm and rhyme.
            Books and pens become our loyal kin,
            As we embark on the journey to begin.
            
            Within these walls, a sanctuary to explore,
            Boundless horizons, we strive to soar.
            Lectures, labs, and endless debates,
            As we navigate the realm of fates.
            
            The morning sun awakens weary eyes,
            With coffee cups, we watch the dawn arise.
            Late nights spent, lost in endless toil,
            Seeking solace in the library's coil.
            
            With minds aflame, ideas interweave,
            In lecture halls where scholars conceive.
            Through words and numbers, equations dance,
            Unlocking secrets of life's cosmic expanse.
            
            The camaraderie we forge along the way,
            In study groups that linger past the day.
            Together, we conquer every challenge faced,
            A tapestry of souls, intricately laced.
            
            Exams loom, a tempest drawing near,
            Sleepless nights filled with doubt and fear.
            Yet resilience blossoms within our hearts,
            As we strive to showcase our finest arts.
            
            Amidst the stress, laughter finds its place,
            In shared jokes and moments we embrace.
            We celebrate achievements, big and small,
            Encouraging each other to stand tall.
            
            But life as a student is not all books,
            For friendships grow in hidden nooks.
            We revel in adventures, wild and free,
            Discovering who we truly long to be. 
            
            So let us raise our voices in acclaim,
            To the student life that kindled our flame.
            For in its embrace, we found our way,
            Guided by the sun, through night and day.
            
            And when we leave these hallowed grounds,
            Our spirits soar, like birds unbound.
            With dreams ignited, we shall take flight,
            Fueled by the student life's eternal light.</p>
