          <p>
            Answer, Answer, Question<br>
            For someone like you<br>
            And it would be like a shooting star<br>
            I would be a reckless gambler<br>
            But you know you're not what they think<br>
            And I'm willing to bet<br>
            There'd be an earthquake if I bet against you<br>
            I'll bet all I have on you<br>
            But it comes down to the final shot<br>
            I'd do anything and everything to have got that dream come true<br>
            All I tried to do to try not to let it get away<br>
            To find out what I was thinking and what I was doing<br>
            Who you are to be, who you are to be<br>
            That's another question, another answer<br>
            Answer, answer, question.<br>
            You are to be, you are to be

          <p>
            Now I've Dropped Everything<br>
            I've fallen in love with you so easily<br>
            You don't have to be scared of me<br>
            Now I've dropped everything<br>
            I've found a girl<br>
            For this chance that we share<br>
            You don't have to be scared of me<br>
            I could see it in the way her eyes shone<br>
            Let's have a past, let's kiss goodbye<br>
            And as we smoke in the ashtrays<br>
            I wonder if we'll ever run on this memory, oh<br>
            Oh no, no, no<br>
            Let's stop all this screaming<br>
            And never ever leave on the past, oh<br>
            I don't want to see<br>
            The tears that nobody cries<br>
            I don't want to feel the joy of love again<br>
            Never get to feel my loneliness<br>
            I just can't seem to get much closer<br>
            Then I had hoped

          <h3>Last Journey</h3>
          <p>
            In the shoes of my grandfather, I stand,<br>
            Seeking solace in words, guided by his hand.<br>
            Through these verses, I strive to comprehend,<br>
            The journey he undertook, until his life's end.<br>
            <br>
            A grand symphony of life once did he weave,<br>
            Full of vigor, strength, and passions to believe.<br>
            Yet fate's cruel hand struck him with despair,<br>
            An accident, a battle he fought, unfair.<br>
            <br>
            In these walls, his spirit did reside,<br>
            Beneath pale lights, where hope and pain collide.<br>
            But through it all, a resilience unfurled,<br>
            His spirit, unyielding, in an uncertain world.<br>
            <br>
            Each day a struggle, a test of his might,<br>
            Challenged by shadows that loomed in the night.<br>
            Yet his spirit remained unbroken and strong,<br>
            For love and family, he carried along.<br>
            <br>
            With every word he penned, every story told,<br>
            His legacy lives on, a treasure to behold.<br>
            Through these verses, his memory survives,<br>
            His last journey complete, as his spirit thrives.<br>

          <h3>Lost in Time</h3>
          <p>
            In the depths of history, I find my way,<br>
            Lost in time, where past and present sway.<br>
            Ancient ruins whisper tales of old,<br>
            Stories of love, valor, and secrets untold.<br>
            <br>
            Through the corridors of time, I wander,<br>
            A time traveler, seeking moments to ponder.<br>
            I walk the paths once walked by those before,<br>
            Imagining their lives, their triumphs, and more.<br>
            <br>
            The crumbling walls echo with the past,<br>
            Each brick a memory, destined to last.<br>
            I feel the weight of time upon my soul,<br>
            As I delve deeper, seeking stories untold.<br>
            <br>
            The whispers of the ancients fill the air,<br>
            A symphony of voices, heard everywhere.<br>
            Lost in time, I am connected to the past,<br>
            A timeless journey, an experience to last.<br>

          <h3>Whispers of the Sea</h3>
          <p>
            I stand upon the sandy shore,<br>
            As waves crash and gently roar.<br>
            The salty air, a kiss so sweet,<br>
            A symphony of whispers, the sea's heartbeat.<br>
            <br>
            I listen closely to the murmurs low,<br>
            Secrets of the ocean, it wants to bestow.<br>
            Tales of ancient seafarers and lost treasure,<br>
            Of love and longing beyond measure.<br>
            <br>
            The waves embrace my weary feet,<br>
            Their touch, a comfort, so bittersweet.<br>
            They carry away my worries and fears,<br>
            And in return, they gift me with tears.<br>
            <br>
            With each crashing wave, a cleansing release,<br>
            A moment of solace, a sense of peace.<br>
            The whispers of the sea, a soothing song,<br>
            Filling my heart, where I belong.<br>

          <h3>City Lights</h3>
          <p>
            In the heart of the city, where dreams collide,<br>
            Neon lights shimmer, painting the night sky.<br>
            A symphony of car horns and bustling feet,<br>
            The rhythm of life, a pulsating beat.<br>
            <br>
            Skyscrapers soar, reaching for the stars,<br>
            Casting their glow, like cosmic memoirs.<br>
            Streets alive with stories, untold and unseen,<br>
            A tapestry of lives, woven in between.<br>
            <br>
            Faces pass by, strangers in the crowd,<br>
            Each with a tale, silent and proud.<br>
            From all walks of life, they converge and depart,<br>
            In this city of dreams, a place to restart.<br>
            <br>
            Amidst the chaos, I find solace and peace,<br>
            A sanctuary of inspiration, where worries cease.<br>
            For within these city lights, I am free,<br>
            To chase my dreams, to be who I want to be.<br>
